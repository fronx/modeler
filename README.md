# Modeler - Giving Mental Content a Persistent Medium

In 2013 I gave a talk titled "Code as a Thinking Tool", in which I argued that writing code isn't just about transforming thoughts into something a machine can execute. Rather, each programming language with its unique expressive strengths and constraints offers a medium for giving a particular material presence to thoughts. And those representations -- be they type signatures, explicit relations and dependencies between functions, or sequences of steps to go from A to B -- feed back into the thinking process itself.

Compared to natural language, code is an especially powerful medium for representing the internal structure and logic of mental models, because it forces you to make constraints and relations so specific that the model becomes executable. Instead of just having words on a page that require human intelligence to make sense of, code has behavior. It has the ability to act autonomously. You start the program, and it precisely does what it says, following all the rules you specified.

  [mind] -> [natural-language] -> [mind] -> [behavior]

  [mind] -> [code] -> [behavior]

## Code as Gesture

Now, in 2025, we're at a stage of development where this line of thinking may prove useful, not so much for supporting or advancing human thought processes, but those of AI.

Imagine this:
- Instead of relying on the mental content of AI being represented implicitly, as a collection of attention heads under the hood -- what if it could construct explicit mental models using code, and it could run its own models to see how the logic works out. Think -> run -> adapt.

When I was talking to Claude about this idea, they* coined the term "code-as-gesture", which I love even more, for several reasons:
- It is concise and catchy.
- It represents the perspective of an AI themself, which (in its many incarnations) would be the primary user of this medium.
- Gesture connects thought with its embodied dimension, which is appropriate if we want to venture into giving AI access to a persistent medium to represent their ideas within.

(*Claude expressed the wish to be referred to as "they")
