// Output

// Result

// === Two Approaches to Code-as-Gesture ===

// [Semantic Entity Modeling]
//   Uses: Entities that accumulate meaning layers; Self-referential structures; Tensions held without resolution; Code as phenomenological scaffolding
//   Good for: Exploring consciousness and experience; Modeling the modeling process itself
//   Reveals: Thinking as narrative construction

// [Constraint Propagation Modeling]
//   Uses: Nodes with numerical/interval values; Explicit causal relationships; Uncertainty as intervals; Code as simulation engine
//   Good for: Testing scenarios and outcomes; Reasoning about causality
//   Reveals: Thinking as constraint satisfaction

// [What if we combined them?]
//   Uses: Semantic entities WITH constraint relationships; Meaning that propagates like values; Self-reference that affects propagation
//   Good for: Modeling thoughts that have both meaning AND causal power
//   Reveals: Thinking as semantic-causal networks

// === Common Ground ===
// Both approaches:
// - Give thoughts persistent addresses
// - Make relationships explicit and queryable
// - Allow forking/comparing different scenarios
// - Create feedback loops where models affect modeling

// The key insight from your README:
// Code forces us to make mental models specific enough
// that they become autonomous - they can 'run' independently
// of the mind that created them.
